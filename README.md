Car sales prediction using advanced machine learning techniques
Auto Trader is one of the largest companies in the UK for selling and buying cars. It is an automotive marketplace which allows sellers and buyers of cars to interact and connect. Users can search for their desired cars based on some specification namely year of registration , car model, price, etc. In this project we mainly focus on building advanced machine learning models to predict the price of the cars based on some relevent features like mileage and year of registration. With regards to the dataset, we used a dataset provided by Autotrader which is not made public. The process has been divided into several steps as stated below:

- Part 1: Importing Data and required libraries
- Part 2: Data Processing for Machine Learning (e.g., detect and deal with noise (i.e., erroneous
values), missingvalues, andoutliers; categorically-encode, rescaledata; splitdataintopredictors
and target; obtain train/validation/test folds).
✔ detect and deal with noise (i.e., erroneous
values), missingvalues, andoutliers; categorically-encode, rescaledata; splitdataintopredictors
and target; obtain train/validation/test folds.
- Part 3: Feature Engineering
✔ derive features based on domain knowledge; produce polyno-
mial/basis functions and interaction features
- Part 4: Feature Selection and Dimensionality Reduction
✔ perform manual selection guided
by domain knowledge and exploratory data analysis, run and report on automated selection
algorithms for most useful predictors
- Part 5: Model Building
✔ choose suitable algorithm(s), fit and tune models; grid-search, rank,
and select model(s) on based on evaluation metrics and under/overfit trade-off; build an
ensemble with best performing models/configurations
- Part 6: Model Evaluation and Analysis
✔ evaluate selected model(s) according to popular
score and loss metrics with cross-validation, analyse true vs predicted plot, gain and discuss
insights based on feature importance and model output space.
